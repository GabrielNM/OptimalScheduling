# BESS Scheduling Optimization in Microgrids

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of an innovative methodology for optimizing the scheduling of a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) within a microgrid. The approach combines a deep learning-based solar irradiance forecasting model with an enhanced battery degradation model, integrated into an optimal scheduling strategy. The goal is to optimize battery usage while minimizing degradation-related costs, resulting in a more efficient energy management system.

## Key Features

- **Deep Learning-Based Solar Forecasting**: Utilizes a sophisticated model to predict solar irradiance, improving the accuracy of energy generation forecasts.
- **Enhanced Battery Degradation Model**: Incorporates a novel realistic battery cost formulation that considers varying depths of discharge, allowing for full utilization of the battery's state of charge while minimizing degradation costs.
- **Optimal Scheduling Strategy**: Leverages the solar forecasting model's predictions to optimize battery scheduling, reducing operational costs by 3.5% compared to traditional methods.
- **Comprehensive Case Study**: Includes a comparison with state-of-the-art energy management techniques, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.
